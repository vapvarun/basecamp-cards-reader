### Index Structure
```
wp-content/uploads/basecamp-index/
├── projects.json      # All project metadata
├── cards.json         # All cards with searchable content
├── columns.json       # Column structures
├── people.json        # Team member directory
└── meta.json          # Index metadata and timestamps
```
