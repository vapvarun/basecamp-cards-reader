)

for card in "${CARDS[@]}"; do
  echo "Processing: $card"
  wp bcr extract_feedback "$card" --plugin=tutorlms >> all-feedback.txt
done
```

## URL Format Support

The plugin automatically detects and handles:

- **Cards**: `https://3.basecamp.com/ACCOUNT/buckets/PROJECT/card_tables/cards/CARD_ID`
- **Todos**: `https://3.basecamp.com/ACCOUNT/buckets/PROJECT/todos/TODO_ID`

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Check current status
wp bcr auth --check

# If expired, reset and reconfigure
wp bcr auth --reset
# Then reconfigure via admin: wp-admin/options-general.php?page=basecamp-reader
```

### URL Format Issues
- Ensure URLs contain either `/cards/` or `/todos/`
- URLs must be from `*.basecamp.com`
- Check that the URL is accessible with your authentication

### No Output
- Verify the card/todo exists and is accessible
- Check authentication with `wp bcr auth --check`
- Ensure you have proper permissions in Basecamp

## Benefits Over Manual Testing
